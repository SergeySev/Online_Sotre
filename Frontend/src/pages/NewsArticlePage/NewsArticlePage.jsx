            The online hypermarket of goods for home, summer cottage,
            construction and repair analyzed the demand for battery, hand and
            power tools in October 2021 and compared these figures with the same
            period in 2020. This autumn, Russians bought goods in this category
            more often by 38%.

            “Several factors could have influenced the growth in demand in the
            category of instruments. In 2021, housing commissioning in Russia
            increased by almost 30%, which led to an increase in the number of
            repairs in new apartments. Also this year, the Russians admitted
            that they began to save on repairs and, if possible, carry them out
            on their own. In this regard, many of them needed their own tool,
